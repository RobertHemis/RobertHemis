Heya, lovely people out there! I'm a full-time student and a self-proclaimed introvert. I find solace in my books and my solitude. But that doesn't mean I don't like to connect with people! I may be quiet in person, but I love chatting with like-minded souls over social media. Currently studying at college- let's see where life takes me next! 🎓📚 #studentlife #introvert #collegeadventures
